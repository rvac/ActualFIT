Description: This document describes the procedure for deploying FIT on Heroku using a Windows local machine. To do so, follow the steps listed below.

1. Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one.
2. Install GitHub for Windows, including command line tools. It can be downloaded at "http://windows.github.com".
3. Create a Heroku account if you do not already have one.
4. Install Heroku Toolbelt for Windows. It can be downloaded at "https://toolbelt.heroku.com/".
5. Fork the ActualFIT repository located at "https://github.com/AIEg0r0v/ActualFIT/", then clone it to a local directory refered to in what follows as <FIT_HOME>. For instructions on forking and cloning, see "https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo".
6. Open a command line and navigate to <FIT_HOME>.
7. Log-in to Heroku by typing the following at the command line: "heroku login".
8. Create an RSA public/private key pair to be used by heroku by typing the following at the command line: "ssh-keygen -t rsa". This will result in two files named "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub". Copy these two files to the $HOME/.ssh directory of your Windows installation (e.g. "C:\Users\Bob\.ssh").
9. Upload the generated public key to Heroku by typing the following at the command line: "heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub". 
10. Create a new app on Heroku by typing the following at the command line: "heroku create".
11. Verify that the app has been created and git is aware of it by typing the following at the command line: "git remote". This should list two branches: "heroku" and "origin".
12. Deploy the aplication to heroku by typing the following at the command line: "git push heroku".
NOTE: If at this point you encounter authentication issues, see this post on StackOverflow: "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15000662/git-heroku-permission-denied-public-key-after-adding-public-key". Generating the RSA private/public key pair manually and uploading the public key to Heroku as described in steps 8 and 9 above will very likely solve the problem.
13. Verify that the application has been deployed and is ready to use by typing the following at the command line: "heroku open". This will open a browser window with the FIT Sign Up page.
14. In the opened browser window, create the first FIT user account.
15. Open the Rails Console by typing the following at the command line: "heroku run console".
16. Assign the first user administrator privileges by typing the following in the Rails Console: "User.first.grant :admin". FIT is now deployed and ready to use.

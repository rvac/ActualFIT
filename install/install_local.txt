Description: This document describes the procedure for deploying FIT on a local Windows machine. To do so, follow the steps listed below.

1. Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one.
2. Install GitHub for Windows, including command line tools. It can be downloaded at "http://windows.github.com".
3. Install Ruby 1.9.3 using Ruby Installer for Windows. It can be downloaded at "http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/". In the following, we will refer to the Ruby installation directory as <RUBY_HOME>.
4. Install RubyInstaller DevKit (mingw64-32-4.7.2). It can be downloaded at "http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads". Instructions for installing the DevKit are available at "https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit". In the following, we will refer to the DevKit installation directory as <DEVKIT_HOME>.
5. Add <RUBY_HOME> and <DEVKIT_HOME> to the Windows PATH variable.
6. Install Rails. It can be downloaded at "http://rubyonrails.org/download".
7. Install the RubyMine IDE. It can be downloaded at "http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby".
8. Fork the ActualFIT repository located at "https://github.com/AIEg0r0v/ActualFIT/", then clone it to a local directory refered to in what follows as <FIT_HOME>. For instructions on forking and cloning, see "https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo".
9. Open ActualFIT in RubyMine. The IDE will detect that a number of required gems are not installed, and offer to install them. Accept by pressing "Install missing gems" in the pop-up on the top right of the screen.
10. From the RubyMine tool bar, select the "Development: ActualFit" configuration and run it by pressing Shift+F10 or the green Run button. This will open a browser window with the FIT Sign Up page.
11. In the opened browser window, create the first FIT user account.
12. In RubyMine, open the Rails Console (Tools->Run Rails Console...).
13. Assign the first user administrator privileges by typing the following in the Rails Console: "User.first.grant :admin". FIT is now deployed and ready to use.
